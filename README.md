- `flake8` — for checking Python code style
- `bandit` — for Python security linting

**Types of tests:**
- Unit test for Python ([/Unit Tests/Process_Command.py](https://github.com/Kazualov/endoscopy_tool/blob/Tests/Unit%20Tests/Process_Command.py))
- Integration tests ([Integration_Tests](https://github.com/Kazualov/endoscopy_tool/tree/Tests/Integration_Tests))
- Unit tests for Flutter ([test](https://github.com/Kazualov/endoscopy_tool/tree/Tests/test))
- Static analysis tools in CI pipeline ([workflow](https://github.com/Kazualov/endoscopy_tool/actions/runs/16092200891/workflow))

### Build and deployment

### Continuous Integration

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI). The CI workflows are triggered on every push and pull request.

#### CI Workflow

The CI pipeline consists of the following jobs:

- **Lint Python** (`lint-python`)
- **Lint Flutter** (`lint-flutter`)
- **Build Flutter App for Windows** (`build-flutter`)
- **Python Tests with coverage** (`test-python`)
- **Flutter Tests with coverage** (`test-flutter`)
- **Security Check with Safety** (`security-check`)

### Continuous Deployment

We use a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow to build and package the Flutter Windows app.

#### CD Workflow

- **Workflow Name**: Build Flutter Windows App
- **Triggers**:
  - Automatically on push to the `main` branch
  - Manually via the GitHub Actions UI (`workflow_dispatch`)
- **Build Output**: Windows executable (`.exe`) and related files, uploaded as an artifact

📄 Workflow file:  
👉 [Build Flutter Windows App](https://github.com/Kazualov/endoscopy_tool/blob/main/.github/workflows/windows-build.yml)

#### Build Steps

1. Checkout the code (with Git LFS support)
2. Set up Flutter 3.32.4 on the stable channel
3. Enable Windows desktop support
4. Install dependencies (`flutter pub get`)
5. Build the release version for Windows (`flutter build windows --release`)
6. Upload the compiled app as a GitHub Actions artifact

## 🧱 Architecture

### Static view

The system is composed of several loosely-coupled, highly cohesive components:

![Component Diagram](docs/architecture/static-view/component-diagram.png)

- **Frontend (GUI)**: Displays the user interface, handles user actions.
- **Backend**: Coordinates sessions, voice commands, AI detection, and storage.
- **AI Detection Module**: Analyzes videos to detect polyps.
- **Voice Processor**: Interprets commands using Vosk speech-to-text.
- **Screenshot Drawer**: Stores and displays doctor-marked frames.
- **File Storage**: Saves session videos and screenshots locally.
- **Metadata DB**: Stores structured information about sessions and detections.

> Components interact via internal calls, maintaining separation of concerns and enabling easy updates and testing. High cohesion and modularity ensure maintainability.

### Dynamic view

The following sequence diagram represents the process when a doctor uploads an endoscopy video for analysis:

![Sequence Diagram](docs/architecture/dynamic-view/sequence-diagram.png)

### Deployment view

The application is deployed as a **standalone desktop app** on the doctor’s PC. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI), an embedded backend with AI detection logic, voice command processing (using Vosk), local video/screenshot storage, and a local database managed with SQLAlchemy (typically using SQLite).

![Deployment Diagram](docs/architecture/deployment-view/deployment-diagram.png)

- All modules run locally within a single process or bundled executable.
- Data privacy is preserved by avoiding any cloud or network interaction.
- The system is updated via installer, requiring no advanced setup or configuration.

> This deployment choice simplifies usage in clinical environments where network connectivity may be restricted and data confidentiality is critical.
