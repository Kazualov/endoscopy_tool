We use a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow to build and package the Flutter Windows app.

#### CD Workflow

- **Workflow Name**: Build Flutter Windows App
- **Triggers**:
  - Automatically on push to the `main` branch
  - Manually via the GitHub Actions UI (`workflow_dispatch`)
- **Build Output**: Windows executable (`.exe`) and related files, uploaded as an artifact

ðŸ“„ Workflow file:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Build Flutter Windows App](https://github.com/Kazualov/endoscopy_tool/blob/main/.github/workflows/windows-build.yml)

#### Build Steps

1. Checkout the code (with Git LFS support)
2. Set up Flutter 3.32.4 on the stable channel
3. Enable Windows desktop support
4. Install dependencies (`flutter pub get`)
5. Build the release version for Windows (`flutter build windows --release`)
6. Upload the compiled app as a GitHub Actions artifact
