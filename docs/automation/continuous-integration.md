### Continuous Integration

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI). The CI workflows are triggered on every push and pull request.

#### CI Workflow

The CI pipeline consists of the following jobs:

- **Lint Python** (`lint-python`)
- **Lint Flutter** (`lint-flutter`)
- **Build Flutter App for Windows** (`build-flutter`)
- **Python Tests with coverage** (`test-python`)
- **Flutter Tests with coverage** (`test-flutter`)
- **Security Check with Safety** (`security-check`)
