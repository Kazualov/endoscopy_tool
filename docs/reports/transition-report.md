## ‚úÖ Usefulness and Transition Summary

### Is the product complete?
> The following components are complete and tested:
> - Video Player
> - Screenshots
> - Uploading a video
> - Drawing device for screenshots
> - Launching a live stream video
> - Voice control
> - Add anomaly detection using the model
> - Add the ability to view inspection records
>
> The following parts are **not yet fully complete**:
> - "Change the interface style according to the
 customer's wishes"
> - "Improving the detection model for better polyp
 recognition"
> - Deployment for Windows
> - Combined exe file


### Is the customer using the product?
> The customer has tested the product weekly and reviewed its functionality.
  However, they are not the main user‚Äîthe primary user will be their colleague, a doctor.
  Since the product is related to medicine, it must be fully completed before being used.
  Until then, preliminary use is limited, as an incomplete product would not be sufficiently useful or safe.

### Has the customer deployed it on their side?
> ‚ùå No  
  Not yet, as we haven‚Äôt finished merging the two files into a single executable for easy installation,
 and the main user‚Äîthe doctor‚Äîhas not yet had the chance to fully evaluate the product and confirm that everything works properly.

### What measures are required for full transition?
- [ ] Complete integration:  Finalize merging the separate files into a single installer to simplify deployment and installation on target machines.
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixing: Conduct thorough end-to-end testing to identify and resolve any remaining issues, ensuring the product is stable, reliable, and ready for medical use.
- [ ] Add maintenance guide to README

### Future Plans
> The customer plans to:
> - ‚úÖ Continue using the product
> - ‚úÖ Expand functionality internally
> - ‚ùì Possibly collaborate on future versions (conditions: [e.g., funding, supervision])

## üß† How to Ensure Long-Term Usefulness
> - Provide clean deployment documentation.
> - Provide 2 months of email support (agreed informally).
> - Archive training video on product usage.
> - Modular code structure to simplify future extensions.

## üí¨ Customer Feedback on README

> We reviewed the README with the customer. Feedback:
> - ‚úÖ Instructions are mostly clear.
> - ‚ö†Ô∏è Add troubleshooting section (e.g., common Docker issues).
> - ‚ö†Ô∏è Add brief overview of architecture (helpful for future devs).

### ‚úçÔ∏è Two Requested Sections (now added)
1. **Deployment checklist (for customer)**  
   Explains final steps required for first-time deployment.

2. **Basic maintenance instructions (for customer)**  
   Contains info on resetting DB, logs, and restarting server.
