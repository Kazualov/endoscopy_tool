## ✅ Usefulness and Transition Summary

### Is the product complete?
> The following components are complete and tested:
> - Video Player
> - Screenshots
> - Uploading a video
> - Drawing device for screenshots
> - Launching a live stream video
> - Voice control
> - Add anomaly detection using the model
> - Add the ability to view inspection records
>
> The following parts are **not yet fully complete**:
> - "Change the interface style according to the
 customer's wishes"
> - "Improving the detection model for better polyp
 recognition"
> - Deployment for Windows
> - Combined exe file


### Is the customer using the product?
> The customer has tested the product weekly and reviewed its functionality.
  However, he is not the main user—the primary user will be his colleague, a doctor.
  Since the product is related to medicine, it must be fully completed before being used.
  Until then, preliminary use is limited, as an incomplete product would not be sufficiently useful or safe.

### Has the customer deployed it on their side?
> ❌ No  
  Not yet, as we haven’t finished merging the two files into a single executable for easy installation,
 and the main user—the doctor—has not yet had the chance to fully evaluate the product and confirm that everything works properly.

### What measures are required for full transition?
- [ ] Complete integration:  Finalize merging the separate files into a single installer to simplify deployment and installation on target machines.
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixing: Conduct thorough end-to-end testing to identify and resolve any remaining issues, ensuring the product is stable, reliable, and ready for medical use.
- [ ] Add maintenance guide to README

### Future Plans
> The customer plans to:  
> - ✅ Continue using the product  
> - ✅ Expand functionality internally, including improvements to training models and execution speed  
> - ❓ Possibly collaborate on future versions with the development team (under discussion)

## 🧠 How to Ensure Long-Term Usefulness
> - Provide clean deployment documentation.
> - Provide 2 months of email support (agreed informally).
> - Archive training video on product usage.
> - Modular code structure to simplify future extensions.
